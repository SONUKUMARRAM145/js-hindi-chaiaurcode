let name="sonu";
let repono=50;
//console.log(name+repono);
// but we don't use this technique in modern days to conacatenate

// we use backtiks
console.log(`hello my name is ${name} and my repocount is ${repono}`); // this is the good way called string intupulation.
 // another way of declaring string

 const gameName=new String('ranji'); // this stores key value pair which u can see in console
 console.log(gameName[0]); // this will print (r) of ranji
